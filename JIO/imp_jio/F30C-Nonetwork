ISSUE   ::: F30C - No Network, CLM- 1242446 -Device fail to latch on Network post replacing CPU

Below code is seen in the simlock_run_algorithm() function in oem source files, which is not present in QC code. 

Seems fuse_blown() is returning false and so below check becomes true and returns generic error.

 

Please check (comment below code )

 

if(!simlock_fuse_is_fuse_blown())
{
return SIMLOCK_GENERIC_ERROR;
}
