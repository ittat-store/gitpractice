Steps to make bootable SD-Card with Android for Kemsys Skate-212 Single Board Computer based on Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 series (APQ8009):-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Take a SD Card of minimum 16GB or 32GB.

2.	Conncet SD Card to PC and run "fdisk -l /dev/<sd card name>" command in terminal which gives complete infomation about SD Card like
	total size, total no. of sectors, sector size and partitions.
	For Example,
		Disk /dev/sdb: 15.9 GB, 15931539456 bytes
		64 heads, 32 sectors/track, 15193 cylinders, total 31116288 sectors
		Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
		Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
		I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
		Disk identifier: 0x00000000
		
		Device Boot	Start        End        Blocks        Id     System
		/dev/sdb1        2048        31116287   15557120      83     Linux		<== partition info

3.	If SD Card have by default partitions, we need to delete them.
	Run "fdisk /dev/sdb" command and delete all partitions until we don't get message "No partition is defined yet!". 
	Then, output will be as shown below
		Disk /dev/sdb: 15.9 GB, 15931539456 bytes
		64 heads, 32 sectors/track, 15193 cylinders, total 31116288 sectors
		Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
		Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
		I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
		Disk identifier: 0x00000000
	
		Device Boot	Start        End        Blocks        Id     System

4.	Another way to Format the SD Card:	Open Disks from system applications and format SD Card from there also.

5.	Take partitions.xml file and create one more file i.e. partition.txt accordingly. It have information like(name,size,align,type,format,file) 		of all the hlos & nhlos binary files which we need to flash inside the board through SD Card.

6.	Compile the source code and collect all the binaries which are mentioned in the partitions.txt and put them inside a folder.

7.	Go to path where all above binaries are available and run the command i.e.
		sudo ./mksdcard -o /dev/sdb -p partition.txt -i ../lk_sdboot/build-msm8909/ -s 16G

8.	Once the command is completed, eject the SD Card from PC and insert it into the Board.

9.	Check bootstrap switches on the board, it should be like (refer Kemsys Data Sheet for SD Card bootup):
		switch 1 = OFF
		switch 2 = ON

10.	Power on the board and enjoy.
